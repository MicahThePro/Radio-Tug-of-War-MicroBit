This game requires two BBC micro:bits. Both micro:bit v1.5 and micro:bit v2.21 are supported with this project.

How to Set Up:

Download the .hex file in the latest release and plug in both of your micro:bits into your computer.
Copy the .hex file and paste it into the root of both micro:bits.
Wait until both micro:bits are not flashing and both display a singular dot in the center of the screen.

How to Play:

Both players spam the A button to try to bring the dot over to their side. Every 5 button presses moves the dot one single LED.
If the dot reaches all the way to the players' side, they win.
The B button resets the game whether you're still playing or not.

ENJOY!
